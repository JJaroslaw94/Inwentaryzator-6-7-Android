# "Inwentaryzator" - Android Project

Program made in Android Studio as school assignment.
Purpose of this program is to help user with storing objects by specifying a storage location with a name that resembles real place or object like a room or a box.
With that, objects that user stores can be listed in the app. If user needs that stored object, it can be found by putting object name in search bar, which displays the location that is stored at.
